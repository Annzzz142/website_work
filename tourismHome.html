                    <h2>About Kerala</h2><br>

Mayyazhi (Mahe / Mahe) is a part of Pondicherry (Puducherry) and lies within Kerala. Though the Lakshadweeps in the Arabian Sea is part of the Union Territories, it has a close alliance with the linguistic and cultural heritage of Kerala.
 
Before the independence of India, Kerala was one of the princely states in india. Later on 1 July 1949, the princely states of Travancore and Cochin united to form the Travancore-Cochin State.

<h4 style="text-align: left;">The Land</h4>
 
The tropical climate and the rich monsoons offer beautiful landscapes, presence of abundant water bodies, long beaches and more than 40 rivers add to the charm. Popular by the name "God's Own Country", the location of Kerala is geographically located between 74 0 7 '47 "and 770 37" 12 "north latitudes and  80 17 '30' and 12 0 47 east longitudes. 
 
The most popular legend on the origin of Kerala says that Kerala rose up from the sea when Lord Parasurama threw his axe into the Sea from Gokarna.  Lord Parasurama, believed to be the sixth avatar of Lord Mahavishnu, threw his axe from Gokarna southward across the ocean in rage and in repentance for his actions of killing the kshatriyas and the sea receded upto where his axe had fallen and brought up a narrow strip of land called Kerala.
 
Geographically Kerala is divided in east- west direction into three parts- Highland, Mid plains and coastal areas. The area in and around the Western Ghats or Sahyadri are mostly hilly and thick evergreen rainforests. The major rivers of Kerala originate from these highlands. Silent Valley in Palakkad district is one of the bio-diversity hotspots in the world. The highest peak in Kerala is Anamudi (2695 m).  On the West, the Coastal belt lies parallel to the Western Ghats. In between, the highland and coastal plain lies the mid-lands. It is generally a combination of hills and valleys. The 41 rivers flowing to the Arabian Sea and the lakes in the west, the three eastern flowing rivers, the lakes and backwaters make Kerala a water rich land mass. <br><br>
 
<h4 style="text-align: left;">Weather</h4>
 
Kerala experiences a tropical climate, as it is normally located at a distance of 80 from the equator. There are three types of seasons in Kerala - June-September South-West monsoon (Edavappathy), October - December North-East monsoon  (Thula Varsham) and summer season(March- May).

The climate of Kerala is characterized by mild winds and rapid monsoon showers. <br><br> 

<h4 style="text-align: left;">Tourism</h4>
 
Sun blanched white seashore. Endless beaches. Incessant blue waves, mostly calm, but sometimes boisterous, clamouring and vanishing among white splashes. Green groves of coconuts just stop short and border the beaches with frills. 

Lurking in the backdrop a network of lagoons and backwaters. Boats and country crafts moving along. Quite a lot of rivers and countless rivulets flowing through hills and paddy fields of the midland, emptying themselves into the backwaters.

And the far off dark blue mountains. This is what the eyes meet about Kerala. An excellent colour scheme and art work of Nature. An occasional boatsman rowing and singing with cargo or people. A tiller or a mower and women planting seedlings. Women at work spinning coir. Dense plantations further eastward. Kerala is all these and more.
